## Project Overview

The Comment Toxicity Analysis project aims to develop a robust Natural Language Processing (NLP) model that identifies and classifies toxic comments in online platforms. With the rise of social media and user-generated content, the prevalence of harmful and abusive language has become a pressing concern. This project addresses the urgent need for automated tools that can help mitigate toxic interactions and foster a safer online environment.

## Objectives

- **Toxicity Detection**: The primary goal of this project is to accurately detect and classify various types of toxicity within comments, including insults, threats, and hate speech.
- **Real-time Analysis**: The model is designed to provide near real-time feedback on comment toxicity, enabling platform moderators to take swift action against harmful content.
- **User Empowerment**: By flagging toxic comments, we empower users to engage in more constructive conversations and reduce the overall toxicity of online discussions.

## Methodology

The project employs a machine learning approach, utilizing state-of-the-art NLP techniques and pre-trained models to enhance accuracy and efficiency. The key steps include:

1. **Data Collection**: A diverse dataset of labeled comments is compiled, representing a range of toxicity levels and types. This dataset serves as the foundation for training and evaluating the model. I used the dataset from Kaggle(COMMENT TOXICITY).
2. **Text Preprocessing**: Comments undergo thorough preprocessing, including tokenization, normalization, and vectorization, to prepare them for model input.
3. **Model Training**: The model is trained using a combination of supervised learning techniques and transfer learning from existing NLP models to improve performance.
4. **Evaluation**: Rigorous testing is conducted to assess the model's accuracy, precision, and recall ensuring it meets the desired performance benchmarks.

## Results

The final model demonstrates significant improvements in toxicity detection capabilities, with high accuracy and robust generalization to new, unseen comments. The output includes clear classifications for each comment, indicating its toxicity level and type.
